    <p>This week was an introduction to electronic circuits.
    <br><br>
    In electronics, physics, and all other science fields we use the International System of Units (SI units) to measure different quantities. SI units include seven standard units; meter, second, kilogram, ampere, kelvin, mole, and candela. From these seven base units, we can derive other SI units of measurements, such as watts, volts, and ohms.
    <br><br>
    In addition, SI units can have prefixes, such as kilo, centi, or milli to signify what multiple or submultiple of a quantity you are using. This is helpful when you have to work with very large or very small measurements.
    <br><br>
    When it comes to electronic circuits, there are a few quantities that are really important to know: voltage, amperage, and resistance. Voltage (V), or electrical potential energy, is the difference in charge between two points on a circuit. This is like the pressure that pushes electrical charge from one point to another. With battery powered circuits, voltage means the difference in electric potential energy between the positively charged terminal and negatively charged one, or it can mean the change in electric potential energy across a resistor.
    <br><br>
    Amperage measures the electrical current in amps (I), in other words how much charge (in coulombs) is moving through a point, per second.
    <br><br>
    Resistance, measured in Ohms (&ohm;), represents how much the charge is impeded. This can be by a lightbulb, or motor, or anything else that requires electrical energy to run.
    <br><br>
    The movement of electrical charge in a circuit can be modeled by water in a pipe. In this analogy, amperage is related to how much water is flowing per second. So a wider pipe would allow more water to flow per second, and thus it would have greater amperage than a narrower pipe. Voltage is like how much “force” is pushing the water through a pipe due the difference in amount of water from one place to another. Lastly, resistance is anything that prevents the flow of water, like a blocked pipe.</p>

        </div>
    <br>
    <p>These three quantities are related by Ohm’s Law which states that a current is proportional to its voltage and inversely proportional to resistance. This equation can be rearranged to solve for the other two quantities as well.</p>

        </div>
    <br>
    <p>In the image below, the charge passes from the terminal, through the resistor, and back through the terminal. This is an example of a closed circuit. The circuit channel forms a complete loop, which allows for the flow of charge to occur.</p>
        <div class="img-container">
        <img src="images/week_10/current-flow.jpg" alt="circuit diagram" style="max-width:80%;height=auto">
        </div>
    <br>
    <p>If a circuit does not form a complete loop, if there is a disconnect at a point, then the electron flow would not be possible and it would be an incomplete circuit. This is called an open circuit. In these diagrams, the lightbulb is being turned on and off by a switch that closes and opens the circuit.</p>
        <div class="img-container">

        </div>
    <br>
    <p>If a closed circuit does not have enough, or any, resistance in it, then this may cause a short circuit. When this happens, too much charge flows through the circuit at once, and the energy will start to build up in the form of heat, which is bad. Short circuits can happen in a few ways, like when not enough resistance is added to a circuit, or when a current gets redirected down an unintended path because that path has much less resistance than any others.
    <br><br>
    There are two basic types of circuits: series and parallel. Series circuits have resistors lined up one after another in a loop. Here, to calculate total resistance you simply have to sum the amounts of all the resistors. This type of circuit only has one pathway for the current to flow through, so the amperage stays consistent throughout, however there is a voltage drop across each resistor in a series circuit.
    <br><br>
    In parallel circuits, resistors are arranged so that each is connected individually to the terminal. In other words, the current coming from the terminal has to split up to get to the different resistors. Then, once it passes through, the current joins back together as it goes back to the terminal. The voltages across different resistors in a parallel circuit are equal, and that amount is the same as the total voltage in the circuit. Total resistance in a parallel circuit is calculated by the equation below.</p>

        <img src="images/week_10/parallel-resistance.jpg" alt="parallel resistance equation" style="max-width:80Cir%;height=auto">
        </div>
    <br>
    <p>Some complex circuits are not clearly a series or parallel circuit, but a combination of the two. It’s helpful to simplify these types of circuits by combining together resistors that are adjacent in series formation; and the same for resistors adjacent in parallel formation.
