    <p>In this assignment I tested five different materials using the Epilog laser machine, and I made a wooden box with a living hinge.</p>
    <br>

    <h3>Part 1: Testing Materials</h3>
    <h4>Making test cut files in Illustrator</h4>
    <p>My first step was to make minature test swatches that I would use to figure out the right settings for the laster machine. The test cuts were one inch squares, and on those squares I included some text and a solid shape, because I figured both of those things would be helpful for deciding the engraving settings. <br><br> Before this project, I was already familiar with Adobe Illustrator, so I used that software to create all of my designs. <br>This is the Illustrator file for my mini test cuts: <a href="files/p2small_test_cut.ai" download="OReardon-test-cut.ai">OReardon-test-cut.ai</a>.</p>
        <div class="img-container">
        <img src="images/week_2/p2small_tester.jpg" alt="Adobe Illustrator design" style="max-width:80%;height=auto">
        </div>
    <br>
    <p>Before moving on to the laser machine, I made a template for the actual material swatches. These were a bit bigger at about 2 1/2 inches. I left spaces where the raster and vector settings could be typed in, once I figured out what those settings should be. This is the Illustrator file for my material swatches: <a href="files/p2materialSwatches.ai" download="OReardon-material-swatches.ai">OReardon-material-swatches.ai</a>.</p>
        <div class="img-container">
        <img src="images/week_2/p2material_block.jpg" alt="Adobe Illustrator design" style="max-width:80%;height=auto">
        </div>
    <br>
    <h4>Using the Epilog Laser</h4>
    <p>Next, I gathered my materials to cut: 1/8" plywood, 1/8" acrylic, 1/8" cardboard, printer paper, and 100% cotton fabric. For each test, I went through this process:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Chose initial settings</li>
            <li>Printed the file through the Epilog App</li>
            <li>Prepared the Epilog machine by focusing the laser and setting the origin point</li>
            <li>Assesed the quality of the cut and engravings</li>
            <li>Adjusted the settings accordingly</li>
            <li>Repeated steps 2-5 until satisfied with the results</li>
        </ol>
    <p>Choosing the initial settings was more or less a guessing game, but once I made a first cut on a material it became easier to figure out how I should change the settings from there. To keep track of the adjustments I made, I used post-it notes to label the test cuts. As you can see in the image below, it took several tries on most of the materials to get a clean cut and visible text. By the way, there were several more attempts with the wood test cuts that were not pictured here. My goal with that material was to find the lowest possible power that could cut through the wood, in order to minimize the scorch marks. For the acrylic and cardboard, these materials were fairly easy to cut. On the paper, I underestimated how high I needed to set the raster's power; and for the cotton fabric I overestimated the power level.</p>

        </div>
    <br>
    <p>Once I decided all of the raster and vector settings, I typed those settings into the template that I made for the material swatches, and engraved them one at a time.</p>

    <h3>Part 2: Box with a Living Hinge</h3>
    <h4>Inspiration & Design</h4>
    <p>When researching living hinge examples, I came across wooden, book shaped containers with really cool laser cut designs. I really liked the idea and look of these boxes, so I decided to base my version off of these examples from <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/789651225/wooden-living-hinge-box-w-design-cover" target="_blank">Etsy</a> and <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/make:19570" target="_blank">Thingyverse</a>.</p>
        <div class="img-container">
        <img src="images/week_2/p2inspiration1.jpg" alt="laser cut book design" style="max-width:35%;height=auto"> <img src="images/week_2/p2inspiration2.jpg" alt="laser cut book designs" style="max-width:45%;height=auto">
        </div>
    <br>
    <p>However, I wanted a different design for the front part of the book. So, I found a vector image on Adobe Stock to use.</p>
        <div class="img-container">
        <img src="images/week_2/p2adobeStock.jpg" alt="Adobe Stock screenshot" style="max-width:80%;height=auto">
        </div>
    <br>
    <p>In Illustrator, I edited this image so that the small shapes would be laser cut, and the center would have my initials.</p>

        <img src="images/week_2/p2illustratorDesign.jpg" alt="Illustrator book design" style="max-width:80%;height=auto">
        </div>
    <br>
    <h4>Flex Box Settings</h4>
    <p>Using an open source box generator, called Boxes.py, I adjusted the dimensions of FlexBox4 to be book shaped.</p>
        <div class="img-container">
        <img src="images/week_2/p2FlexBoxSetting.png" alt="screenshot" style="max-width:55%;height=auto" > <img src="images/week_2/p2flexBoxGenerator.png" alt="screenshot" style="max-width:35%;height=auto">
        </div>
    <br>
    <p>Then, I inserted my cover design into the .svg file that I downloaded from Boxes.py.<br>This is my laser cut ready file: <a href="files/FlexBox4.svg" download="OReardon-FlexBox4.svg">OReardon-FlexBox4.svg</a>.</p>
        <div class="img-container">
        <img src="images/week_2/p2actualvector.png" alt="Illustrator design" style="max-width:80%;height=auto">
        </div>
    <br>
    <h4>Laser Cutting</h4>
    <p>When cutting the parts for my box, I found that I had to increase the vector power from what I had used on my 1/8" plywood swatch, even though the box was made from the same material. Besides that, it cut and engraved everything very nicely. I thought there was going to be an issue with the small holes, but the machine automatically cut those areas twice. Also, I added some texture to the three thin sides to look like pages.</p>

    <h4>Final Product</h4>
    <p>I am really happy with how this book turned out! This is by far the coolest thing that I've made with the laser cutter yet.</p>
